# Custom Channels Examples

[Channels](https://getchannels.com) allows you to add your own custom channels using streaming sources.

It utilizes M3U formatted playlists to let you define and describe these streaming sources as custom channels along with customizations to make them look great inside the app. This repo contains some examples to give you an idea of how it works.
